# Interactive-Audio-or-Video-Based-Q-A-System

## Inspiration
      We were inspired by the growing need to quickly access information from audio and video content. 
      With so much content out there whether it’s educational videos, podcasts, or corporate training 
      materials we realized how helpful it would be to extract the information as text and make it 
      searchable. Our goal was to build a system that could take any video or audio file and turn it into 
      something users could easily query for answers.

## What it does
         The system takes an uploaded file and determines whether it is a video or audio.
                   - For Videos: It extracts the audio and converts it into text.
                   - For Audio: It directly transcribes the content to text.
        Once the text is extracted, it is processed using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a 
        technique that retrieves relevant information and generates context-aware responses. The text is 
        stored in ChromaDB, a vector database, which allows for efficient search and retrieval of 
        information. Users can continue asking unlimited questions about the uploaded document until 
        they choose to end the session.

## How we built it
      1.	File Type Identification: The system first determines whether the uploaded file is audio or 
                video.
      2.	Conversion:
                    a.	Video Files: The system extracts the audio from video files and converts it to text.
                    b.	Audio Files: These are directly transcribed to text.
      3.	Text Storage: The transcribed text is stored in ChromaDB, a vector database that organizes the 
                 text for fast and efficient retrieval.
      4.	Q&A Processing: When a user asks a question, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is used 
                to retrieve the most relevant information from the stored text. The system then utilizes gpt-4o 
                to generate context-aware and accurate responses based on the retrieved content.
      5.	User Interaction: Users can ask an unlimited number of questions about the uploaded content. 
                The system continues to provide answers until the user chooses to end the session, ensuring 
                an interactive and dynamic experience.

## Challenges we ran into
      1.	Accurate Transcription: Achieving high transcription accuracy wasn’t easy because of varying 
                speech patterns, accents, and background noise. We had to experiment with different speech- 
                to-text models to ensure better results.
      2.	Efficient Data Retrieval: Fine-tuning the retrieval mechanism in ChromaDB was an iterative 
                process. We wanted to make sure the system pulled out the most relevant information quickly 
                for every user query, which took a lot of adjustments and testing.
      3.	Scalability: Managing large multimedia files and multiple user sessions without slowing down 
                the system was a significant hurdle. We had to optimize our processes to handle larger loads 
                efficiently.
      4.	Session Management: Allowing users to ask unlimited questions in a session while keeping 
                responses accurate and context-aware was challenging. We carefully designed the session 
                handling to maintain continuity.
      5.	Using gpt-4o in RAG: Integrating gpt-4o into our RAG process was exciting but not without its 
                challenges. We needed to balance retrieval and generation so that gpt-4o could provide well- 
                informed, contextually accurate answers based on the document text. Fine-tuning this 
                process to ensure smooth, relevant responses took a lot of trial and error.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
       1.	Successfully created a fully functional system for converting video and audio files to text and 
                providing context-aware answers.
       2.	Integrated ChromaDB and RAG to deliver quick and accurate responses to user questions.
       3.	Enabled users to ask unlimited questions until they decide to end the session, ensuring a 
                smooth and interactive experience.
       4.	Optimized the system to handle larger files and faster retrieval with minimal latency.

## What we learned
       1.	Speech Recognition: We gained experience in handling speech-to-text conversions and 
                ensuring transcription accuracy across different conditions.
       2.	RAG Implementation: We learned how to combine information retrieval and AI generation for 
                contextually accurate responses.
       3.	Vector Databases: Using ChromaDB taught us how to store and retrieve data efficiently for 
                question-answering systems.
      4.	User Experience Design: Managing unlimited user questions required improving session 
                handling and interaction flow.

## What's next for Interactive Audio or Video-Based Q&A System
      1.	Improve Accuracy: Further enhance transcription accuracy and retrieval to provide better 
                responses.
      2.	Handle Complex Queries: Allow the system to process more complex questions that span 
                multiple sections of the document.
      3.	Add Multi-Language Support: Support multiple languages for transcription and user queries.
      4.	Enhanced Scalability: Ensure the system can handle larger files, more users, and more 
                simultaneous sessions with ease.
      5.	Summarization: Add a feature to generate summaries of the uploaded content to give users a 
                quick overview before diving into questions.
